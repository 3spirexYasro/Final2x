# How to Get a Full Glass Theme for Windows 8 for Free
 
If you miss the transparent glass effect of Windows 7 on your Windows 8 computer, you might be interested in getting a full glass theme for Windows 8. A full glass theme is a visual enhancement that makes your windows borders look like glass with blur and transparency effects. It can also change the appearance of your caption buttons, window shadow, glow effect, and more.
 
There are several ways to get a full glass theme for Windows 8 for free. One of them is to use a third-party utility called Aero Glass for Windows 8 / 10[^1^]. This utility returns the complete glass effect into windows frames without breaking any system protection or modifying system files. It is fully native and compatible with MSStyle themes and DWM API. It also allows you to customize the look of your windows borders with different theme atlases that you can download from the internet.
